    <p>It's a podcast. A good podcast. With brothers and a dad. And dice.</p>
    <p>There are two complete, years-long stories already in the books. This group costume is from the end of the first one, but you should start at <a href="https://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one">the beginning!</a></p>

  <div class="project_description">
    <p>You can blame <a href="https://twitter.com/inksAton">Derek Atkinson</a>. The rest of the group expected a simple recruitment flyer, but that didn't cause enough sweet, sweet sleep deprivation so here you go.</p>
